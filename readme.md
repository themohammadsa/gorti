# Getting Started

Gorti: An elegant CSS library, to rapidly build, design and customize responsive front-end framework with Gorti.

---

## Description 

This project was made for the purpose of practicing my CSS skills. I have tried replicating the usual day-to-day components that we mostly see on the internet. 
The main aim was to use this CSS Component Library for my upcoming projects, so that I have a better grip on the CSS. 

I have created a PR, I would love it if you could leave your reviews over there on what can be improved.

Here's the link to website:

#### Disclaimer

1. The search box is not yet implemented.
2. I have used a "dummy" react-router implementation by giving a callback from a component. The reason for it is, to just make sure the entire web-page runs on a single link. (Just wanted to try, nothing else)
